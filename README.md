# Tetris-The-Game
Hello everyone, I am **Kanak Negi** and this is my project which I have created just for free play.

**Industry:** LifeStyle

**Project Title:** Tetris-The-Game

**Project Description:**
Tetris is a game based on tetromino, which is a shape constructed with four (tetra) squares. There are seven unique arrangements of four bricks. By unique we mean that even with limitless rotation you cannot bring one unique shape to resemble another unique shape.

In the game of Tetris, each of these shapes has a different color. Historically, there is no color ''standard'' color scheme. Infact, the very first game had all bricks the same color.

The game board is a grid, some times referred to as the well or the matrix. During the game, tetris shapes appear in random order at the top of the well and fall towards the bottom of the well. During their fall, the player is allowed to rotate the shape by 90 degrees each click. The player can also move the shape right or left. After each shape in as low as it can fall, it will freeze into place and a new shape will appear and being falling.

The object of the game is to arrange the pieces at the bottom of the well such that no empty spaces occur. When a row across the well has been filled with sections of a shape, this row will disappear with all pieces above is dropping to occupy the vacated row. The player is scored 50 points for each single row that is cleared like this.

There is a button provided that allows the player to increase the speed of the falling shapes. For each increament of speed increase, the score for each combination of rows being cleared up.
